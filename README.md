# BlackJack
BlackJack card game with multiple players.

#### Short game description:

When the app is loaded, the first game round is already started with the default players number of 2 and the dealer. Each player already got 2 cards.

After that players can start to play turn by turn. When the 1st player finished, then the next player turn begins. Currently active player marked with the “(Active)” suffix label. While one of the players is in progress of making it’s turn, other player will have only option to quit the game.
When the game round is over, it’s possible to add new players, up to 4 persons (so the new players can join before the next round begins). There is actually to any technical limitation to the number of player, it’s just the UI restriction, as with more than 4 players it’s hard to show each players hand properly.

To start next round “Play next Round” button needs to be pressed.
